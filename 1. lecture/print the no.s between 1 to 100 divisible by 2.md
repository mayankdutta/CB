between 1 to 100, print the no.s which are divisible by 2.
1, 2, 3, 4 ...................... 100

REPEAT 
	Check if no. is divisible by 2.

- 1, 2, 3, ....................................... 100
- if certain no. is divisible by 2
- then print it.

counter = 1
REPEAT until counter is less than 100
	if counter divisible by 2
		 PRINT counter
	 INCREMENT counter by 1;






sir user khud se input dega to
if user gives the value 

1, 2, 3 , 4, ............ n
in my case n was 100



PRINT enter range
input n;
counter = 1

REPEAT until counter is less than n
	if counter divisible by 2
		 PRINT counter
	 INCREMENT counter by 1;


is it right sir we only need to use English to describe our logic how we will implement nothing else?
yes thats correct.
