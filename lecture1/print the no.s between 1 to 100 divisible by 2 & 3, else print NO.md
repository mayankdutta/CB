check if no. is divisible by 2&3

	if (counter is divisible by 2) 
		if (counter divisible by 3)
			PRINT counter
		else 
			PRINT NO
	else 
		do_nothing
	INCREMENT counter by 1


generate no.s 1 to 100
check individual no.s if they are divisible by 2 & 3.

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ................. 100
- 0, 1, 2, 3 ...........................100

counter = 0

```
counter = 1

REPEAT till counter <= 100:
	if (counter is divisible by 2) AND (counter divisible by 3):
		PRINT counter
	else 
		do_nothing
  
	INCREMENT counter by 1
 
counter = 1

REPEAT till counter <= 100:
	if (counter is divisible by 2) 
		if (counter divisible by 3)
			PRINT counter
		else 
			PRINT NO
	else 
		do_nothing
  
	INCREMENT counter by 1
