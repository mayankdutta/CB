lazy way: 


if there is division. 
there should be two no.s
let number1 be 'a'
let number2 be 'b'
let ans be 0

if b is 0:
	there cannnot be an answer.
else 
	ans = a/b
finally you will tell your friend that final_outcome is ans.




summary: 
take two numbers as input, store them in two variables a, b.
if denominator is 0
print result a/b;


algorithm: 


PRINT: enter number one
INPUT: input taken in a.

PRINT: enter number two
INPUT: input taken in b.

if b is 0: 
	PRINT: Runtime error
else: 
	PRINT: a/b



print: enter two no.s
input: take two no.s

if b is 0: 
	PRINT: Runtime error
else: 
	PRINT: a/b
